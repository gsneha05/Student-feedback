# Student-feedback
Universities frequently gather extensive feedback from students on various courses and professors to enhance the quality of education. However, as the volume of feedback grows, manually analyzing this data becomes increasingly challenging. The sheer amount of qualitative data makes it difficult to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and quantify the overall sentiment. This often results in delayed or superficial responses to student concerns, hindering the university's ability to promptly address issues and improve educational outcomes. There is a need for efficient, scalable solutions that can process and analyze this feedback in a timely and accurate manner.Then we came up with the student feedback analysis application in which Sentimental Analysis on the data,the category of the feedback(positive,negative or neutral) is written into the AIPrediction column and the confidence level of the review is written into the Confidence column of the excel sheet.
